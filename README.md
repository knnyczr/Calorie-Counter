## Future Project Plans

Unfortunely, this project did not achieve everything I originally set out to do as my mother had surgery and that did ake away some time. That's not an excuse however and I fully plan on revisiting many aspects in this project, especially the CSS becuase I would like to reduce the amount of white space present. Looking further ahead towards additional features, I really would want to add in a place (maybe another view file) for a graph which will save the past days total calories and macros and display them. Another idea I was thinking about would be to implement an API which provides the actual images of the foods the user as inserted, think of the images the self check out machines use at the grocery stores. In this way, the site would not be so heavy on text but also have intresting visual elements applied to it. 

If you have any further suggestions, feel free to comment them in the issues.
